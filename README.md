Project Overview
This project is a responsive website featuring a hero section with dynamic text and a call-to-action button, along with a section displaying cards. The design adapts seamlessly across various screen sizes, including mobile, tablet, and desktop views. The primary goal of the project is to ensure optimal user experience on any device, with particular attention to the positioning of content within the hero section.

Approach Used
Structure
The website layout is built using Flexbox, ensuring that elements are aligned and distributed efficiently across different screen sizes.
A mobile-first approach was implemented, which means the base styles cater to mobile screens first, and specific styles are then overridden as the screen size increases (using media queries).
The hero section contains a headline (<h1>), a subheading (<p>), and a button (<button>). These elements are positioned based on screen size:
On mobile devices, all content is centered.
On tablet and desktop views, content is aligned to the top left, with the button appearing at the bottom left.
The cards section is designed to be responsive as well. On larger screens, cards are displayed in a row, while on smaller screens, they stack vertically.
Media Queries
Media queries were utilized to ensure that the layout adapts to different screen sizes:

Mobile View (default): Content is centered and stacked.
Tablet View: Hero content is aligned to the top left, and the card section is displayed in a row.
Desktop View: The hero section content remains at the top left, and the cards are arranged horizontally.
Styling
Flexbox: Ensured that the hero section's content and the card section are aligned properly on different screen sizes.
Positioning: For desktop and tablet views, absolute positioning was used for the hero section's text and button to ensure that they are placed correctly.
Typography: Font sizes were adjusted based on the screen size using media queries to ensure readability on smaller devices and prevent text from becoming too large on larger screens.
Challenges Faced
Challenge 1: Content Overlap in Desktop View
At one point, the "Get Started" button was overlapping with the text in the hero section. This occurred because the positioning was not correctly adjusted for the larger screen, which caused the button and text to be positioned in the same space.

Solution:
By adjusting the positioning and ensuring that elements in the hero section are spaced out with relative positioning and absolute positioning for specific elements (text and button), the issue was resolved. The hero content is aligned properly on both mobile and desktop views.

Challenge 2: Aligning Content for Different Screen Sizes
Initially, content alignment across different screen sizes caused some elements to appear misaligned, especially the text and button in the hero section.

Solution:
The solution was to use media queries to apply different positioning styles based on the screen size. This ensured the content was properly aligned in each view:

Mobile: Centered content.
Tablet: Aligned content to the left and adjusted font sizes.
Desktop: Ensured proper spacing and alignment of the hero content.
Challenge 3: Ensuring Flexibility in Card Layout
The card layout needed to adjust seamlessly from stacked cards on small screens to horizontally aligned cards on larger screens. Ensuring that the content did not break or overflow was a challenge.

Solution:
Flexbox was employed for the card layout, and media queries were used to adjust the flex-direction. On small screens, cards are stacked vertically, while on larger screens, they are aligned horizontally in a row.

Conclusion
The project was successfully completed with a focus on responsive design and ensuring that the website adapts seamlessly to various screen sizes. The use of Flexbox, media queries, and absolute positioning helped in creating a layout that is both functional and aesthetically pleasing across all devices.
